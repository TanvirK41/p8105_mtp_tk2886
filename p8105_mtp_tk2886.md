# Problem 1

### Loading the p8105\_mtp\_data.xlsx data set and cleaning the data set

``` r

The research report describes the relationship between posture and
“enlarged protuberances”, especially among younger subjects (however
there are older aged participants) The research article is one of the
article from 2018, Nature Scientific Reports. Originally, the dataset
that was given and loaded had 1,221 participants. I have noticed in the
abstract of the report, the researcher mentions that n = 1200, but there
is 1,221 participants in our dataset.

After analyzing one of the 2018 Nature Scientific Report that describes
the relationship between posture and “enlarged protuberances”,
especially among younger subjects, there are key components that need to
be identified. This data set has **1221**. This data set has **9**. The
number of observations in this research study that is between ages 18-86
is **1221**. The key variables in the dataset are **sex, age,
age\_group, eop\_size\_mm, eop\_size, eop\_visibility\_classification,
eop\_shape, fhp\_size\_mm, fhp\_category**.

``` r
eop_dfc %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_group) %>% 
  summarise(
    frequency = n()) %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = frequency) %>% 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c('Age Group', 'Female', 'Male'),
               caption = "**Table1:** Age and Gender Distribution.**")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

**Table1** showcases the age group and gender distribution. The age
group of 18 to 30 has the most male and female participants.

**Table2:** Table 2 indicates that there is a miss-classified data in
both Female and Male. The reason why the NA values were

After going through the data. There is a female participant who was
classified as 17 years of age but the report abstracts states that the
participants must be between the ages of 18-86. We do not know if the
age was mistakenly entered. We many not assume if it the participant was
truly 17 years of age and we may not put that participant in any of the
other age group without first consulting with the researcher. Also there
is a male participant who was classified as 45 years of age, however
that participant was being grouped in the less than 18 years of age
category. I did not include that participant because we do not know if
45 is really the participant’s age or if it’s different age without
consulting with the researcher.

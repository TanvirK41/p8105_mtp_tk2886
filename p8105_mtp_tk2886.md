**Data Cleaning Process:** In order to having meaningful result, I first
organized the data by re-coding the numerical values into meaningful
information that is easier to understand. I converted specific values to
numeric data type so that the numerical data values are not character
data type. I converted the data groups to factor data type since each
group has a fixed number of possible value and anything else will result
in NA. Lastly, I arranged my data by sex and age.

``` r
eop_dim <- eop_dfc %>%
  dim()

eop_row <- eop_dfc %>%
  nrow()

eop_col <- eop_dfc %>%
  ncol()

eop_key_var <- eop_dfc %>%
  names()
```

There are **1221** participants in the study. However **2** of the
participants are not classified correctly. The key variables in this
data set are **sex, age, age\_group, eop\_size\_mm, eop\_size,
eop\_visibility\_classification, eop\_shape, fhp\_size\_mm,
fhp\_category**.

    values_from = Count) 

freq_agegrp <- 
  eop_dfc %>% 
  group_by(age_group) %>% 
  summarise(
    frequency = n()) %>%
    mutate(percentage = prop.table(frequency)*100) 


Age_gender_Distribution <-
  left_join(gender_count, freq_agegrp, by = c("age_group" = "age_group")) %>%

**FHP DISTRIBUTION PLOT:** The distribution of FHP size of male is
larger than female. The FHP size variability increases as the age
increases with age group 60+ having the highest FHP distribution.

**EEOP RATE PLOT:** One tread that is observed is EEOP rate decreased
and then increased for both gender. EEOP rates is higher in male
population than in females among all age groups. The largest EEOP rate
is in the 18-30 age group for both gender and lowest rate is in 41-50
age group for gender.

### Verifying the Mean

``` r
#Calculating the mean and standard deviation for the whole population for FHP size 
eop_dfc %>%
  summarise(Mean = round(mean(fhp_size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)), 
            Standard_Deviation = sd(fhp_size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = 
                 "The **reported mean of FHP of the total sample population is 26** and this is consistent with the mean that is calculated with R code: **26** is the mean.")
```

| Mean | Standard\_Deviation |
|-----:|--------------------:|
|   26 |            13.00552 |

The **reported mean of FHP of the total sample population is 26** and
this is consistent with the mean that is calculated with R code: **26**
is the mean.

``` r
#Calculating the mean and standard deviation of FHP size for male and female 
eop_dfc %>%
  filter(age_group != "NA") %>%
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = round(mean(fhp_size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)), 
            Standard_Deviation = sd(fhp_size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("Sex",
                  "Mean",
                  "Standard Deviation"),
    caption = 
      "The **reported mean of FHP in male is 28** and **for female is 24**. This is consistent with the mean that is calculated which also indicates that **28** is the mean for men and **24** is the mean for female.")
```

| Sex    | Mean | Standard Deviation |
|:-------|-----:|-------------------:|
| female |   24 |           10.62294 |
| male   |   28 |           14.66856 |

The **reported mean of FHP in male is 28** and **for female is 24**.
This is consistent with the mean that is calculated which also indicates
that **28** is the mean for men and **24** is the mean for female.

### Verifying Standard Deviation

``` r
#Calculating the mean and standard deviation of FHP size for female and male in each age group 
eop_dfc %>%
  filter(age_group != "NA") %>%
  group_by(age_group, sex) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = round(mean(fhp_size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)), 
            Standard_Deviation = sd(fhp_size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    caption = 
      "The **reported mean, standard deviation of each sex in the age group** is *consistent* with the calculated data. It is consistent with the reported data because I looked at the error bar (Figure 3) in the report. I compared my calculated mean and standard deviation with mean and standard deviation showcased in the error bar.")
```

| age\_group | sex    | Mean | Standard\_Deviation |
|:-----------|:-------|-----:|--------------------:|
| 18-30      | female |   23 |            8.326453 |

| 41-50      | female |   22 |            8.041778 |

| 60+        | female |   27 |           14.194158 |
| 60+        | male   |   38 |           17.251677 |

The **reported mean, standard deviation of each sex in the age group**
is *consistent* with the calculated data. It is consistent with the
reported data because I looked at the error bar (Figure 3) in the
report. I compared my calculated mean and standard deviation with mean
and standard deviation showcased in the error bar.

Prevalence %>%

    caption = "Table shows the Prevalence of participants in the sample size with Enlarged External Occipital Protuberance (EEOP).")
```

| Prevalence |
|-----------:|
|   32.10483 |

Table shows the Prevalence of participants in the sample size with
Enlarged External Occipital Protuberance (EEOP).

EEOP is *defined* as individuals who have **exceeded 10mm in size for
their bony outgrowths**. I used the variable eop\_size\_mm. I filtered
that variable by focusing on individuals who have exceeded 10mm in
growth size. The calculated prevalence of **EEOP** is **32.10%** which
is similar to the author’s value **33%**.

```

| FHP Rate |

Table shows the FHP Rate among individuals over 60 and focusing on FHP
size of 40mm. The **reported rate for FHP size over 40mm and among age

40mm and among age group of 60+ because in the *Table FH40*, it is
indicated is it more common in the age population of 60+.

# **Part 4: Conclusion**

My data analysis findings indicated that there are various
inconsistencies and misclassification with the data that was provided.
For example, individuals were grouped incorrectly, specific data values
in the dataset were not correctly labeled which led to incorrect
grouping, and the calculated statistical value did not align with the
reported values. The figures and conclusion the author provided may be
invalid because of the data misclassification. While my graph show that
younger adults (18-30 years of age) have higher rate of EEOP than other
age group and my statistical calculation shows that older age (60+)
population have higher prevalence of forward head protraction (40mm size
obversevred the most), we may not state that there is causal
relationship between the usage of cell phone and horn growth because of
the the numerous inconsistencies with the data. I would like researchers
to first gather data on how many hours young adults uses their cell
phone and see if there’s positive correlation between high usage hours
of cell phone and EEOP.
